## Overview
The project involves refactoring of apartment booking services by  an object-oriented architecture. This allows for better modularity, scalability, and maintainability of the system. The assignment covers advanced programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and custom exceptions.

### Key Features
1. **Guest and Product Management**:
   - Object-oriented classes for `Guest`, `Product`, `ApartmentUnit`, and `SupplementaryItem`.
   - Maintain records of guests, apartments, and supplementary items.

2. **Order System**:
   - Class `Order` for managing guest bookings.
   - Include support for reward points and discount redemption.

3. **Menu-driven Operations**:
   - Interactive interface with options to add/update/view guests, apartments, and orders.
   - Automatically handle invalid inputs using custom exceptions.

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Read and write guest and product data from/to `.txt` files.
   - Support for bundles as complex products with a discounted rate.

### Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Python script file `ProgFunA2_<Your Student ID>.py`.
3. Place the required data files (`guests.txt`, `products.txt`, etc.) in the same directory.
4. Run the script in a Python interpreter.
5. Use the menu-driven interface to manage bookings and view reports.

### Tools and Libraries
- Python (Standard Libraries: `sys`, `datetime`, `os`)
